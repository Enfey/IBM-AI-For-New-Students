## Project Goals and Vision

The vision of this project is to create an intuitive AI assistant that empowers students to independently navigate university life. By reducing reliance on human support staff, it provides students with timely, accessible, and personalized guidance. In the future, this system aims to expand to support multiple campuses and deliver cross-cultural assistance.

## **How to Use**

1. **Ask Questions**: Users can ask questions like "Where is the library?" or "How can I pay the tuition fee?".
2. **Get Personalized Recommendations**: The chatbot provides customized suggestions based on the studentâ€™s interests and behavior.
3. **Create new Session:** Users can create a new session which is a similar idea to the chat history to restart their conversation.
4. **Feedback/Introduction Page:** Users can see the latest annoucement on the website with all possible ways to contact us. Additionally, a designed product page is accessible in the side menu bar.



## Key Features

1. ***Conversation flow***: Powered by Wasonx assistant, the app provides different action routes for users like location searching and so on.

2. ***Log in/out***: Utilizing firebase, we built a safe login/logout authentication.

3. *RAG*: Using milvus and langchain, we built a RAG extension, and it is deployed on Azure with the help of Docker container technique.

4. ***Google Map embedded***: With the help of Google Map API, we sucessfully embed a dynamic map in our website for location searching use case.

5. ***Setting***: We allow users to change the theme of the app, more features might be developed in the future.

6. ***History***: The app use automatically record the history using sessionID as the primary key.

   > [!Warning]
   >
   > We currently can not recall the history but only recording them, since we only have access to the lite plan of the watsonx assistant.

7. ***Live2d***: We made our own live2d using Cubism, then with the help of oh-my-live2d (a open project on github the it is implemented on our website)

8. ***Other Pages***: Other pages like Contact Us, Announcement, About, Resources were added to provide a better user experience, also benefitting our future updating.



## **Key Topics**

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions using RAG.
- **Location searching**: The students can get detailed location searching assistance in our website.
- **Campus Introduction**: provide a brief introduction of the campus.  
- **IT service**: Provide service help to the students' IT issues.

## **Usage Scenarios** (Main Use cases)

> [!TIP]
>
> We currently only focused on a few use case and let the openAI model with RAG to deal the other users' question.

- **Freshman Onboarding**: New students can ask questions about facilities, schedules, and orientation activities.
- **Campus Navigation**: Students can request navigation assistance for campus buildings.
- **Event Recommendations**: Students can receive personalized event and activity suggestions.
- **Campus related problem**: Students can ask some additional quesitons like EC problem and tuition probelm...



## **Testing**

We employ **Lighthouse** and **Jest unit testing** to ensure high code quality. Tests are located in the `tests/` directory.
