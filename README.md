## Project Goals and Vision
The vision of this project is to create an intuitive AI assistant that empowers students to independently navigate university life. By reducing reliance on human support staff, it provides students with timely, accessible, and personalized guidance. In the future, this system aims to expand to support multiple campuses and deliver cross-cultural assistance.
