# 01/11/24 Meeting

## Topics Discussed

1. **DMS Coursework part 2**
    - Explored initial ideas for the manifesto and produced some draft points to get a feel for the task.
2. **Requirements Sprint planning**
    - Discussed potential methods to attain data necessary for successful requirement elicitation.

## Outcome

- Team members are to individually produce some closed or open questions to ask first year students. These can be refined following Monday's meeting.
- Target of ~40 requirements/user stories set: as Roberto mentioned previously this is a suggestion.
- Setup a meeting with industry sponsor on 04/11/24 at 3pm to discuss requirements and present sprint planning materials.
- Format for user story established:
- _Actor -> User Story Description -> Functional/Non-functional_

## Decisions to be made/discussed further

1. **UI design requirements**
    - A possible way to elicit user requirements I've thought of is that each team member produces 3 paper prototypes: for desktop, tablet and mobile respectively.
    - We can then corroborate and get an idea of how we've each initially interpreted the project.
    - The best ideas can be used to produce 3 draft versions which we could show to a range of first years and get further feedback and iterate etc.
2. **Tech stack research**
    - I'd advise each team member to do further research into our chosen stack, particularly the following technologies:
        - React/Carbon Design implementation
        - Node.js
        - Figma and its support for carbon design components
        - Watsonx.ai foundation model REST API
        - Prompt declaration language
        - Fine tuning foundation models (if necessary)
    - I imagine this the least complex our technologies/stack will get; depending on requirements we can make additions e.g., JWT, Next.js etc or removals.
