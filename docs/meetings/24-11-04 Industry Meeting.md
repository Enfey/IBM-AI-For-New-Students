# 04/11/24 Meeting

## Topics Discussed

1. **Sprint planning and project management**
    - Presented project management resources to industry supervisor (Trello + Roberto's document)
    - Discussed our initial approach to planning the project and our ideas for eliciting requirements
2. **Technical project aspects**
    - Discussed concerns about tech stack being used for the project, and other technical features e.g., auth,
    - Outlined our preliminary steps for implementation.

## Outcome

### Sprint Planning and Project Management

1. **Trello board adjustments**
    - Addition of a column for 'blocked tickets' and for 'tickets to be discussed(icebox)' prior to being worked.
2. **Timeboxing and user story estimation and acceptance criteria**
    - Decision made to timebox all decomposed user stories/requirements.
    - Fibonacci scale is to be used for user story importance.
    - Clear acceptance criteria to be a part of all sprint items to facilitate straightforward testing.

### Requirements Gathering

1. **Question list refinement**
    - Updated the question list to contain only closed-ended questions, following industry supervisorâ€™s advice.
    - Plan to use google forms to formalise a questionnaire? (I cant really remember if we decided on this concretely, just mention below if there's any issues with this)
2. **Requirements timeline established**
    - Aim to gather as many requirements as possible before the next meeting with Owen on 15/11/24.
3. **Research on existing solutions**
    - Investigate how other chatbots function, with a particular focus on the **Watsonx Assistant.**

### UI requirements

- Plan to consult UX/UI designer Samia Osman for guidance after developing a preliminary UI prototype
- Ensure information is presented factually, without recommendations
- Advised to do separate prototyping in teams of 2, just for mobile and desktop, and then produce a draft version to show to Samia.

## Further points

1. **More actors/stakeholders**
    - Should definitely make considerations to visually impaired/mobility impaired students for our requirements e.g., As a visually impaired student, website should be accessible, readable, screen reader works etc.
2. Establishing Definition of Done criteria (DoD)
    - I think it would be worthwhile to establish broad, high-level criteria when it comes to development that we can apply to all user stories/features/releases.
    - These vary from project to project, but its important we're all on the same page about when something can be considered 'done'. This may include the following
        - Documentation complete
        - Passed Unit tests
        - Passed integration tests
        - Meets all acceptance criteria
        - Code has been peer reviewed
        - Etc
