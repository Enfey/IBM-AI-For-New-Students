## Dependencies

- I will upload the full list of dependencies once I've researched them for each operating system, namely Linux and Windows. If you use Mac, please tell me so I can post the specification for MacOS as well. This will include but not be limited to:
  - next.js, carbon react - for front-end.
  - node.js, watsonx-ai package - for back-end.
  - jest.js - for testing.

## watsonx

- Can either be **trained on web-scraped data** (which would require developing/finding a web scraper for UoN) or **dialogue trained** which I don't fully understand
  - If we go the web scraping route, it would be done by the **back-end team**
  - Dialogue training is done by the **Watson team**

## Requirements

- Someone said maps aren't provided easily by Nottingham, would like a good map to read
  - Google Maps or OpenStreetMap are two options but are more common sense than helpful
- Differentiate ourselves from ChatGPT, have a mascot for logo/interactivity
  - Mascot could be lion (Robin the lion) or other options...
  - Would be on the website and be animated (akinator style?)

## Use Case Modelling

- Sequence diagram was fine, can be added to the documentation/interim report

Let me know if anything needs to be added/changed!
