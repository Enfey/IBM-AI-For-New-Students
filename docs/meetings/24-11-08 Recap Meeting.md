# 08/11/24 Meeting

## Summary

Hey guys,
We have nearly completed our DMS Coursework Part 1 Task 2, just need to proofread and condense into 300 words. We have established three urgent tasks **we need to complete before the first sprint on 18/11/2024**. These tasks are as followed:

- User story gathering (same format as before)
- Requirements and Specification Modelling (using visual paradigm)
- Design Prototypes (using Figma)

I will now allocate people to these tasks, since we have 8 people, I think we should be able to complete all of these before our first sprint.

## Task allocation

- Parth Amreliya
- Jeshuran Jebanesan
